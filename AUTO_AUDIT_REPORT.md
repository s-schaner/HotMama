# AUTO AUDIT REPORT

## Overview
The audit uncovered several latent runtime issues that prevented the FastAPI stack and plugin ecosystem from working reliably outside the limited unit tests. Critical modules were missing standard-library imports, the plugin API instantiated Pydantic models with mutable defaults, and session routes depended on logging without importing the module. Most notably, the analytics upload endpoint read the entire upload asynchronously but never awaited the validator or wrote the validated bytes back to disk, so processed videos were silently empty.

The fixes focus on restoring missing dependencies, hardening typing expectations, and ensuring validated uploads persist on disk. Core analytics helpers now import the stdlib modules they depend on, the plugin API exposes `Path` and safe list defaults, the session router returns a strongly-typed response model, and upload validation is awaited with the bytes written to the session directory. Auxiliary tweaks include importing `secrets` for secure filenames and ignoring the local `.venv/` to keep commits clean.

## Root Causes by Category
- **Imports:** `core.analysis` referenced `base64`, `math`, and `os` without importing them, triggering `NameError` once heatmaps were generated. `plugins.plugins_api` used `Path` and mutable default lists in Pydantic models without importing `Path` or guarding against shared state. `app.validators` relied on `secrets.token_hex` but never imported `secrets`, and `session.api` logged events without importing `logging`.【F:core/analysis.py†L3-L155】【F:plugins/plugins_api.py†L3-L48】【F:app/validators.py†L3-L123】【F:session/api.py†L8-L210】
- **Pathing/Config:** The session details endpoint declared a `SessionDetailsResponse` but returned a plain dict, relying on FastAPI coercion. Returning the typed model aligns runtime behaviour with the declared schema.【F:session/api.py†L143-L166】
- **Pathing (Uploads):** `process_video_with_tracking` invoked the async validator without `await` and then streamed from the exhausted `UploadFile`, so the on-disk clip was empty. Persisting the validated bytes fixes ingestion. 【F:webapp/server.py†L487-L517】
- **Housekeeping:** `.venv/` was unignored, risking accidental commits of the virtual environment.【F:.gitignore†L1-L5】

## Fixes
- Imported the missing stdlib modules in `core.analysis` so frame extraction and heatmap rendering no longer crash at runtime.【F:core/analysis.py†L3-L155】
- Added the `Path` import plus `Field(default_factory=list)` defaults for plugin hook results, eliminating shared mutable state and NameError risks when loading plugins.【F:plugins/plugins_api.py†L3-L48】
- Ensured the session API imports logging, tightens request/response typing, and materialises `SessionDetailsResponse` instances for detail reads.【F:session/api.py†L8-L166】
- Awaited video validation, wrote the returned bytes to disk, and imported `secrets` for secure filenames so analytics uploads survive ingestion.【F:webapp/server.py†L487-L517】【F:app/validators.py†L3-L123】
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.venv/` to keep the repository clean.【F:.gitignore†L1-L5】

## Tests & Typechecks
- ✅ `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings`【02e82f†L1-L3】
- ✅ `ruff check --fix`【05c6a2†L1-L2】
- ✅ `black .`【cf630d†L1-L33】
- ✅ `pip check`【9ec1cd†L1-L2】
- ❌ `mypy app/ webapp/ core/ llm/ --ignore-missing-imports` (fails on pre-existing type issues across analytics, ingest, and scoring modules plus missing third-party stubs)【8ec8d8†L1-L52】
- ⚠️ `python -m app.main` (FastAPI not installable in the sandbox image)【74ae4b†L1-L9】
- ⚠️ `pip install -r requirements.txt` / dev tooling installs (blocked by corporate proxy)【720e4c†L1-L9】【b7e421†L1-L9】

## Remaining Risks / TODOs
- Type checking still reports dozens of structural issues (e.g., `session/ops.py`, `viz/heatmap.py`, `ingest/video_pipeline.py`) that need annotations and third-party stubs once dependencies are installable.【8ec8d8†L1-L52】
- The FastAPI stack cannot be smoke-tested until `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `slowapi` can be installed in the execution environment.【74ae4b†L1-L9】【720e4c†L1-L9】
- Network proxy restrictions blocked dependency reconciliation and type stub installation; those steps should be repeated in CI or a network-enabled environment.【720e4c†L1-L9】【b7e421†L1-L9】

## Next Steps
- [ ] Re-run `mypy` after adding annotations to ingest/session modules and vendoring the required `types-*` stubs.
- [ ] Provision FastAPI dependencies in CI so `python -m app.main` and `uvicorn` smoke tests can run.
- [ ] Add an integration test for `/ _api/analytics/process_video` to confirm uploads persist and pipelines execute end-to-end once vision dependencies are available.
