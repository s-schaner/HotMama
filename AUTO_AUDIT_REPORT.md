# AUTO AUDIT REPORT

## Overview
The HotMama codebase has been re-architected into a deterministic, container-first platform. The legacy monolith (web UI, ingest, plugins) has been removed and replaced with a minimal FastAPI gateway, a vision worker, and a Redis queue. Installation now hinges on a single bootstrap script that probes host hardware and launches the appropriate docker-compose profile (CPU or GPU). Artifact storage is unified under `./sessions/`, and every service pins its Python/Torch/ONNX/OpenCV dependencies for repeatable builds.

## Key Improvements
- **Service Separation:** API and worker live in `deploy/` with isolated Dockerfiles and requirement manifests. Redis decouples request handling from model execution.
- **Hardware Detection:** `tools/hw_probe.sh` surfaces OS/GPU/container runtime details in JSON; `tools/bootstrap.sh` consumes it to select `cpu`, `gpu`, or `rocm` compose profiles.
- **Deterministic Containers:** Dockerfiles pin Python 3.11.8, Redis 7.2.4, Torch 2.3.0, and CUDA 12.4.1 (for the GPU worker). Health checks and restart policies keep services resilient.
- **Testing Pipeline:** Unit tests cover API enqueue semantics and worker artifact creation; `tools/test_compose_smoke.sh` runs an end-to-end dockerized smoke test. Ruff/Black/Mypy/Pytest configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Documentation:** README now highlights the one-line install, architecture diagram, troubleshooting, and config matrix. `MIGRATION.md` maps legacy commands to the new workflow. Audit logs updated.

## Risks & Follow-Ups
- **ROCm Support:** The ROCm profile is stubbed pending access to AMD hardware/drivers. Marked experimental until validated.
- **GPU Runtime Provisioning:** NVIDIA container toolkit installation still requires sudo/root privileges; bootstrap warns when manual steps are necessary.
- **Model Functionality:** Worker currently ships with a lightweight Torch identity model as a stub. Production deployments should replace it with domain-specific inference logic while keeping the job/queue contract intact.

## Verification
- Unit tests: `pytest` (API + worker).
- Static analysis: `ruff`, `black --check`, `mypy --ignore-missing-imports` (configured via `pyproject.toml`).
- Integration: `tools/test_compose_smoke.sh` (docker compose stack, artifact assertion).

## Next Steps
1. Validate ROCm images on supported hardware and document the workflow.
2. Extend worker processing to load real models (Torch/ONNX) and manage weights via mounted volumes.
3. Wire CI secrets for container registry publishing once GPU build matrices are green.
